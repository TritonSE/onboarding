# Onboarding to Triton Software Engineering

Welcome to the Triton Software Engineering onboarding repository! This repository contains a guide for new developers to learn about our software development process and general software engineering concepts. By following along, you'll create a todo list application using the MERN stack and prepare yourself to contribute to TSE.

Completion of all parts of this guide **before the start of winter quarter** is required for every newly recruited TSE developer. You can work through them at your own pace, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in the **#onboarding** channel on Slack. We want to help!

Please begin by reading the introduction, linked in the table of contents below. As you make progress, feel free to take breaks and come back to where you left off.
