# Part 2

**More features**

Estimated time: 2 to 12 hours

Now that we've implemented an MVP, it's time to start thinking about v2. For v2, we'd like to add these additional features:

- Ability to assign a user to a task
- Task detail page that displays more information about a task
- Ability to edit a task's title, description, and assignee

You can find the designs for these features on the "Part 2" page in Figma. _Note that the walkthrough sections in this part of the guide are intentionally less detailed than those in Part 1._ We hope you feel confident enough to work mostly on your own by this point, but you can absolutely still reach out to **#onboarding** if you get stuck!
