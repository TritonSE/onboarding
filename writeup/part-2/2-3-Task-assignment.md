# 2.3. Implement task assignment

Finally, we'll add the ability to assign users to tasks and see who is the assignee for a particular task.

## New component: `UserTag`

### Specification

[Link to `UserTag` component in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/8eRDNyOrYRgyN7NNb0mIXA/Onboarding-Todo-App?type=design&node-id=38-552&mode=design&t=sAnv6Hgp6SzriN7g-4)

- This component should receive an optional User object as a prop.
- If the user is null or undefined, then display the "Not assigned" message as shown in Figma.
- If there is no profile picture URL, then use the default icon provided in Figma.
- The profile picture should be a 32px by 32px circle.

### Walkthrough

1. Export the user icon from Figma as an SVG.
   1. Right-click on the icon, choose "Select layer > User icon", then click "Export User icon" in the Export panel of the right sidebar.
   2. Save the SVG in the `frontend/public` folder with a name like `userDefault.svg`.
2. In `frontend/src/components`, create two new files: `UserTag.tsx` and `UserTag.module.css`.
3. Write the `UserTag` component. It should be a "pure" component (no state or side effects). Make sure you cover all the possible cases with conditional rendering.

   1. Use an [`<img>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) to display the profile picture. To use the default icon we just downloaded, pass in `src="/userDefault.svg"` (or whatever file name you used).

   <summary><strong>‚ùì Hint: CORS errors</strong></summary>

   _You might encounter a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) permission error caused by the profile picture. This happens because browsers block requests for any resource that's not from the same origin (in our case, `localhost:3000`) by default for security reasons. You can ignore these errors and just use the example profile pictures that we provided (see [Part 2.1](./2-1-Users.md))._
   </details>

4. Add styles to the `UserTag` component. You should just need some layout styling and a `border-radius` on the profile picture.
5. Export `UserTag` from `components/index.ts`.
6. **Optional:** Add a `className` prop and pass it along to the outermost element in your `UserTag` JSX. You can use this prop to make layout easier in the next steps.

## Update to component: `TaskItem`

### Specification

[Link to updated `TaskItem` component in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/8eRDNyOrYRgyN7NNb0mIXA/Onboarding-Todo-App?type=design&node-id=36-307&mode=design&t=sAnv6Hgp6SzriN7g-4)

- `TaskItem` should render a `UserTag` to show who is assigned to the task.

### Walkthrough

1. Add a `UserTag` within the `TaskItem` component. Pass in the task's assignee as the user prop.
2. Add styling for the `UserTag` to give it a fixed width. If you added a `className` prop to `UserTag`, you can pass down styles to it just like with any built-in element. If not, it might be easiest to wrap the `UserTag` in another `<div>`.
   1. You can pick a reasonable width, such as 12rem (192px).
   2. Be sure the `UserTag` sticks to the right side of the `TaskItem` too. The `TaskItem` CSS we wrote earlier should make this happen already, but you might still have to fix something.
3. Check the Home page to verify that `UserTag`s are displayed correctly.

## Update to component: `TaskForm`

### Specification

[Link to updated `TaskForm` component in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/8eRDNyOrYRgyN7NNb0mIXA/Onboarding-Todo-App?type=design&node-id=38-620&mode=design&t=sAnv6Hgp6SzriN7g-4)

- The `TaskForm` should have another text field for the optional assignee ID.
- In `"edit"` mode, the `TaskForm` should call `updateTask` instead of `createTask`. It does not need to reset itself after submitting in this mode.

### Walkthrough

1. In the `TaskForm` component, add a `TextField` for the assignee and move the Save button next to it. You'll have to add a new row for these components in the JSX and another state variable like `title` and `description`.
2. Update the `handleSubmit` function to call `createTask` if `mode` is `"create"` and `updateTask` if `mode` is `"edit"`. For `updateTask`, make sure you include all Task fields, not just those visible in the form. Remember to call `onSubmit` as well if the request succeeds.

## Update to page: `TaskDetail`

### Specification

[Link to updated `TaskDetail` page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/8eRDNyOrYRgyN7NNb0mIXA/Onboarding-Todo-App?type=design&node-id=38-575&mode=design&t=sAnv6Hgp6SzriN7g-4)

- Show a `UserTag` for the task's assignee.
- When "Edit task" is clicked, display the `TaskForm` component in edit mode with the data from this task.
- When the `TaskForm` is submitted, display the task information view again with the updated task data.

### Walkthrough

1. In the `TaskDetail` page component, import `UserTag` and use it to display the assignee.
2. Add another state variable `isEditing` which will store a boolean indicating whether the `TaskForm` is open.
3. Set `isEditing` to true when the "Edit task" button is clicked.
4. When `isEditing` is true, display a `TaskForm` in edit mode prefilled with this task's data; otherwise, display the task information as we just implemented. Upon submission of the `TaskForm`, change `isEditing` back to false and set the `task` state variable to the updated task in the callback.
5. Test your changes by opening the `TaskDetail` page, clicking "Edit task," changing the values, and clicking Save. You can copy and paste user IDs from mongosh. Try this for multiple different tasks and try some special cases: empty form fields, a task ID instead of a user ID, a nonexistent ID, no change in the form, etc.

   <summary><strong>ü§î For new developers: Thinking about the user experience</strong></summary>

   _Pasting user IDs manually isn't a great user experience. In a real project, we could use some kind of dropdown selection menu, possibly with a search bar to filter by name. Can you think of other ways to design this interaction?_
