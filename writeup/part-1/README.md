# Part 1

**Minimum viable product**

Estimated time: 2 to 8 hours

In Part 1, we'll implement the MVP of this application with the following features:

- Ability to create a new task (already done in the starter code)
- Ability to check off a completed task
- List of all tasks in the database

<summary><strong>✅ Good practice: End-to-end features</strong></summary>

_In TSE, we recommend that developers build **end-to-end features**—that is, they build both the backend and frontend parts of a single feature such as "list of all tasks" instead of having one person build the backend and another build the frontend. We've found that when teams do the latter, they often find themselves rushing to connect everything up near the end of the quarter, and bugs often slip through. So, for each feature in this guide, we'll build both sides to help you think about features this way._

</details>

Note that we'll present the backend specification first, then the frontend, for each of the features in Parts 1 and 2. You can implement the frontend first if you like—it's completely up to preference. However, we recommend that you don't start on a new feature before finishing the one you're currently working on.
