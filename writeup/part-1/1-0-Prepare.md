# 1.0. Prepare for development

1. Make sure you can run both the frontend and backend as described in [Part 0.2](../part-0/0-2-Clone.md). You don't need to keep them running while you write code, although it's usually helpfulâ€”both the frontend and backend will automatically reload when you save changes.
2. Open the [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/file/8eRDNyOrYRgyN7NNb0mIXA/Onboarding-Todo-App) for the todo app. You'll refer to this a lot when developing the frontend, so feel free to bookmark it.
3. Checkout a new Git branch: `cd` to your local repo and run `git checkout -b part-1`. During development, you should generally create a new branch for every feature that you work on. In this guide, for simplicity, we'll just create one branch for Part 1 and another for Part 2.

In the following sections, we'll provide a fairly complete specification for each part that you must implement, plus a high-level walkthrough in case you're not comfortable with the tech yet.
